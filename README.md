AutoWidget is a program add-on for Kodi, designed to give a more dynamic and interesting experience to using skin widgets.

See the [Kodi forum post](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=352934) for more information.

## Steps to Install
---
1.  Go to the Kodi file manager.
2.  Click on "Add source".
3.  The path for the source is `https://drinfernoo.github.io/` (Give it the name "drinfernoo").
4.  Go to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from zip".
5.  a.  For AutoWidget's Stable repo, install `repository.autowidget-1.1.zip`.
    b.  For AutoWidget's Dev repo (for testing purposes **only**), install `repository.autowidget.dev-1.1.zip`.
6.  Return to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from repository".
7.  Choose the repository you installed (stable or dev), and install AutoWidget from Program Add-ons.

## How to Use
---
To get started using AutoWidget, open the Kodi context menu on any other menu inside Kodi, like the "Popular" menu from your favorite add-on, or the "Movies -> Titles" section of your video library, and choose `Add to AutoWidget Group`. Follow the prompts to add a new path, and then use your skin of choice to set up a widget directed at the group you created. Reload your skin, and you should have a fresh, shiny new AutoWidget!

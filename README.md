# AutoWidget
AutoWidget is a program add-on for Kodi, designed to give a more dynamic
and interesting experience to using skin widgets. 

## Requirements
While AutoWidget doesn't **depend** on any other add-ons, it is specifically designed for use with skins that use Skin Shortcuts to manage their menu and/or widgets. While a significant amount of work has gone into making sure that it will work with almost any skin which supports Skin Shortcuts, there may be special circumstances that haven't been accounted for. Feel free to open an issue if you find a skin or section where AutoWidget isn't able to initialize and/or update its widgets.

## Steps to Install
1. Go to the Kodi file manager.
2. Click on "Add source".
3. The path for the source is `https://drinfernoo.github.io/` (Give it the name "drinfernoo").
4. Go to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from zip".
5. a. For AutoWidget's Stable repo, install `repository.autowidget-1.0.zip`.
   b. For AutoWidget's Dev repo (for testing purposes **only**), install `repository.autowidget.dev-1.0.zip`.
6. Return to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from repository".
7. Choose the repository you installed (stable or dev), and install AutoWidget from Program Add-ons.

# AutoWidget

AutoWidget is a program add-on for Kodi, designed to give a more dynamic
and interesting experience to using skin widgets. It relies on Skin Shortcuts
to create groups of widget and shortcut paths, which are cycled and displayed
automatically at runtime.

AutoWidget **requires** v1.0.19 of Skin Shortcuts at minimum to function
correctly. Be advised, you **must** install [Marcelveldt's BETA Repository](https://github.com/kodi-community-addons/repository.marcelveldt) prior
to istalling AutoWidget, or it **will not** install.

## Steps to Install

1. Go to the Kodi file manager.
2. Click on "Add source".
3. The path for the source is `https://drinfernoo.github.io/` (Give it the name "drinfernoo").
4. Go to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from zip".
5. a. For AutoWidget's Stable repo, install `repository.autowidget-1.0.zip`.

6. Return to "Add-ons", and choose "Install from repository".
